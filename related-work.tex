\section{Related Work}
Our work builds on recent results in deterministic task and motion
planning. Early work in task and motion planning was embodied in the
aSyMov system~\cite{gravot2005asymov}, where a task plan was generated
and used to guide motion planning. The focus of this work was on
determining a way to solve motion plans in parallel. Dornhege et
al. use semantic attachments to do task and motion planning with
classical planners~\cite{dornhege2012semantic}. This approach makes
use of task planners, but requires symbolic representation of discretized
locations. Havur et al. use local search to
find an optimal geometric configuration before discretizing the
continuous plane into non-uniform cells and using a hybrid planner to
find a feasible motion plan~\cite{havur2014geometric}. Lagriffoul et
al. parameterize symbolic actions with coarse geometric
representations of objects and grasp types. During refinement they
estimate the feasible region for continuous parameters and use these
regions as constraints to reduce geometric
backtracking~\cite{lagriffoul2014orientation}.

Maximum likelihood observation determinization was introduced by Platt
et al.~\cite{platt2010belief}. They used this approach to frame
planning in belief space as an underactuated control problem. They use
LQR and transcription methods to find trajectories in belief space and
characterize scenarios where a replanning strategy is guaranteed to
succeed. Van Den Berg et al. use LQG to solve Gaussian belief space
planning problems that incorporate collision avoidance
constraints~\cite{van2012motion}. They are able to plan without the
maximum likelihood observation assumption and explore the
approximations introduced with maximum likelihood determinizations.
 
Our determinization-replan approach shares similarity with
determinization-replan approaches for probabilistic planning, such as
FF-replan~\cite{yoon2007ff}. Both leverage determinization in order to
obtain major performance gains from classical planners. The maximum
likelihood observation assumption is similar to the most likely
transition determinization from that literature, while our optimistic
belief updates are similar to an all outcomes determinization.
 
Knowledge space representations for planning are an old idea in
artificial intelligence that dates back to McCarthy and
Hayes~\cite{mccarthy1968some}. Bonet and Geffner provide in-depth
experimentation and analysis of discrete deterministic partially
observed planning~\cite{bonet2011planning}.  They provide conditions
under which discrete formulations of partially observable planning
(with binary, factored beliefs) can be compiled to sound and complete
representations. Our algorithms are aimed at large continuous problems
for robotics while their work focuses on classical planning.

The Belief Space Hierarchical Planning in the Now planning and
execution system is a task and motion planning approach to handle
uncertainty~\cite{kaelbling2013integrated}. They construct task plans
in belief space under maximum likelihood observation
determinization. Levihn et al. extend this system to construct shorter
plans at execution time by smart replanning and
reconsideration~\cite{levihn2013foresight}. They formulate the
regression of belief goals under Gaussian distributions and plan with
an exact representation of belief state dynamics. In contrast, we use
references to the belief so our approach more easily extends to
arbitrary belief representations.

Srivastava et al. formulate open world \pomdp s with a probabilistic
program~\cite{srivastava2014first} and develop a generalization of
point-based value iteration to that setting. Both methods attempt to
solve very large \pomdp s. In their setting the challenge is the
(unbounded) size of the world and complexity of corresponding
beliefs. The challenge in our work stems from uncertainty about
continuous quantities.


Gashler et al. use a contingent planner to generate plans that react
to feedback from the world~\cite{gaschler2013kvp}. They generate
contingent plans and use external function calls during their planning
step to generate effects of actions. However, they represent poses and
belief updates symbolically for task planning. We use pose and belief
references to plan abstractly. We refine and verify plans with the
\emph{true} belief.

Nebel et al. use a three valued logic for the TidyUp project that
allows fluents to take the value
\emph{uncertain}~\cite{nebel13aaaiirs}. They assume that uncertain
fluents become known once the robot is close enough and so do not
explicitly plan sensing actions. In contrast, we represent uncertainty
directly and combine reasoning about uncertainty with reasoning about
maximum likelihood states.
