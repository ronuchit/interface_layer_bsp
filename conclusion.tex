\section{Conclusion}
We presented a novel approach to combining task and motion planning
in belief space through the \emph{maximum likelihood determinization}
principle. We evaluated our algorithm on several domains, where it completed
challenging sequences of perception and geometric reasoning by task planning in
an abstract representation of the problem. Potential future work includes experimenting on a real PR2, incorporating noisy transition models between environment states, and answering maximum likelihood queries using methods other than Monte Carlo sampling (e.g., SQP).
