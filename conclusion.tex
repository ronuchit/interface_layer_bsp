\section{Conclusion}
We have presented a novel approach to combining task and motion planning
in belief space through the \emph{maximum likelihood determinization}
principle. We evaluated our algorithm on several domains that involved
challenging sequences of perception and geometric reasoning by task planning in
an abstract representation of the problem. Potential future work includes TODO
